Introduction
============

Collection's results in a carousel portlet browsing them by subcollections.

Usage

To create such a portlet you have to:

 * create a Collection (with subcollections) that returns results for showing
   in the portlet;
 * add shelf portlet on a page where you want to add a carousel - click 'Manage 
   portlets' in one of the columns of your site;
 * choose *collective.portlet.shelf* from 'Add portlet...' menu;
 * collective.portlet.shelf portlet is based on the standard collection portlet 
   in Plone, so the same fields are available for this type of portlet as for the 
   standard Collection portlet. Fill in the fields in the portlet edit form, 
   specifying a collection that will provide content for the portlet. 
 * you can specify the number of visible tiles per page
